# SmartCart
SmartCart is an application designed to enhance the shopping experience by allowing users to create a shopping list, either collaboratively with others or individually. It also enables comparison between different supermarket branches based on distance or cart price. The app also suggests products to add to shopping lists, making the process easier and more efficient.
